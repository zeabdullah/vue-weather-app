# vue-weather-app

My first try at Vue.js with the OpenWeather API

## Project setup

1. Open terminal in the root of the project folder and type `npm install` or `yarn install` (IF you've got yarn installed of course)

2. Create an OpenWeather API key on [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org)
3. Copy your API key and paste it into `src/env.example.js` according to its instructions
4. Rename `env.example.js` to `env.js`
5. That's it! All you need to do is run one of the below commands based on what you want to do.

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

`yarn serve` or
`npm run serve`

### Compiles and minifies for production

`yarn build` or
`npm run build`

### Lints and fixes files

`yarn lint` or
`npm run lint`

### Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
